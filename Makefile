# One gate, and CI runs exactly this target.
#
# A local check set that differs from the CI one turns "green here, red there" into the normal state
# of affairs, and then neither is read. So: whatever is not behind `check` is not a gate, and whatever
# is runs the same way in both places. A Gradle `build` target joins this file with B-01.
#
# WHERE THE SIBLING REPOSITORIES ARE, for the report that resolves code anchors. `..` is right for a
# checkout that sits beside its neighbours and for CI, where the parent holds one directory. A clone
# anywhere else sets `REPOS=.`: with `..` at `/`, the report walks the whole filesystem (keel B-08).
